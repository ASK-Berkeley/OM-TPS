# Evaluate
The main driver scripts in this folder are ```evaluate_fastfolders.py``` and ```evaluate_tetrapeptides.py``` for evaluating transition paths for Fast-Folding Proteins (from D.E.Shaw) and Tetrapeptides (from MDGen). These evaluations are automatically called in ```sample.py``` after producing transition paths, but can also be called as standalone scripts after sampling has been performed.

## Commands to Reproduce Experiments in the Paper
See ```sampling_commands.md``` for a list of commands used to generate the results in the paper for the fast-folding proteins and tetrapeptides.
