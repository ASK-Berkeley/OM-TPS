# Models
This folder contains the base code for the diffusion and flow matching model components, both based on code by [Phil Wang (lucidrains)](https://github.com/lucidrains):
1. [DDPM base model](./ddpm.py), based on [this repository](https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch)
2. [Flow matching base model](./flow_matching.py), based on [this repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/flow_matching)
3. [Graph transformer](./graph_transformer.py), based on [this repository](https://github.com/lucidrains/graph-transformer-pytorch)
